# Next Store Prediction Based on Revenue🏪📊

**Next Store Prediction** is a data-driven project designed to help businesses make smarter decisions when planning new store openings. Using real-world data and machine learning, this tool predicts the ideal combination of store size and region (division) to meet a specific revenue target.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Predicts total revenue based on store size, division, and quantity sold
- Recommends the optimal store setup for a given revenue goal
- Provides a clean, interactive UI using Streamlit
- Uses Linear Regression for prediction and Label Encoding for categorical data

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Excel for data input

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset (sales, customer, item, store, etc.)
2. Train a Linear Regression model using store size, division, and quantity sold
3. Use the model to simulate different combinations to reach a target revenue
4. Display the optimal store setup in the Streamlit app
